# IPv4 Subnetting Lab

## Overview

This lab documents my understanding and practice of IPv4 subnetting.

Subnetting is the process of dividing a large network into smaller networks called subnets. It is an important networking skill used in cybersecurity, cloud computing, and system administration.

## Objectives

By completing this lab, I aim to understand:

- IPv4 address structure
- Network address
- Broadcast address
- Host range
- Subnet masks
- CIDR notation
- Number of available hosts

# IPv4 Basics

An IPv4 address is a 32-bit address divided into four octets.

Example:


192.168.1.10


Each octet contains 8 bits.

Binary representation:


11000000.10101000.00000001.00001010


---

# CIDR Notation

CIDR represents the number of network bits.

Example:


192.168.1.0/24


The `/24` means:

- 24 bits are used for the network
- 8 bits are used for hosts

Default subnet mask:


255.255.255.0
